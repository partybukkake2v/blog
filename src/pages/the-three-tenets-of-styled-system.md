# The Three Tenets of Styled System

I released Styled System around a year and a half ago
and since then the library has been growing steadily
and has even resulted in a few copycat libraries that use some of the same conventions.
Up until now, I haven't really written much about the thinking behind the library, but have relied more on my approach of *show don't tell*[^1].
And while the library is certainly an iteration on a theme[^2],
– those who have followed me for years may have a clear idea what it is meant for –
I'd like to expand on what I think makes Styled System really great.

## Three Tenets

At its core, Style System is really meant to enable these three things

1. Style consistently with a global theme
2. Respond to changing requirements quickly
3. Create mobile-first responsive layouts with ease

It's not meant to solve every styling problem out there,
but is focused on some of the issued I've noticed over the years for diverse teams working on codebases where developers and designers may have varying levels of expertise with CSS and other technologies.

- iteration on a theme
- abstraction of css -
- implementation details
- people like to build their own / building blocks
- standardizations

- show don't tell: I find some things difficult to put into words, especially when it's a newer idea, and think that, just like a picture is worth a thousand words, showing code can be a much more powerful way to express an idea in some cases.
