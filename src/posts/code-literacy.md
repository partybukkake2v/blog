Ah yes, everyone loves the age old question: *should designers code?*
As much as I want to write about this,
I think the framing of this question is fundamentally wrong.
At the heart of this conversation is the idea of *code literacy*,
that is, the level at which one can read, write, and understand software code in the form of programming languages.

We never ask whether or not we should teach children to read and write,
or whether we should teach children math.
In a modern society, these are a given in public education systems.
There are still problems that exist within those institutions,
but I think code literacy should be a fundamental part of any school cirriculum.

What is code? Paul Ford has [already written][what is code] more that enough to cover that topic,
but I'd like to step back and consider how code is not dissimilar to written language and mathematics.

- language is innate
- we invented written language
  - written language is not hard-wired into our brains
  - transfer of knowledge across space and time
- math
  - symbolic
  - related but not dependent on written language
  - math really benefits from written language
- code
  - the languages we humans use to communicate with computers
  - we created written language, then computers, then written language to communicate with these computers
  - eventually computers may fluently speak natural languages
  - but there will always be code underlying this abstraction

Saying that code will become less and less fundamental to the progress of technology
is akin to saying that mathematics is less important after the invention of the calculator.
If anything, the opposite is true.

I think that the invention of software might be on par with the invention of mathematics,
but we're too close to the event to see the historical significance.
Mathematics is broad and broadly applicable, and works at a much lower level than code -
software code isn't really possible without mathematics, afterall.
But this is the first time in human history where we've created a technology that requires written language (i.e. software) to operate.

Not everyone in a modern society needs to be a poet, or a bestselling author, or have a PhD in mathematics,
but I think having basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills will benefit anyone.
I think the same is true for code literacy.
Not everyone needs to be a software developer,
but the more you know about how humans communicate with machines,
the more benefits you'll see professionally.

Imagine if all the people working in the financial industry
had a little bit more programming experience -
not enough to warrant a career change,
but enough to realize that mitigating the billions of dollars lost on spreadsheet errors
is something that can be improved upon.
By merely having the ability to see a potential path forward,
these people will become more empowered to make a difference.
The person who solves this well enough will end up very well off.

I think it's fine to not expect someone in a non-developer role to not read and write code professionally.
But I also think the people who are curious and who learn a little more than their peers
will always have the advantage.
