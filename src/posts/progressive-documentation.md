# Progressive Documentation

When building out JS libraries and components, everyone knows the importance of good documentation.

Markdown is an excellent format for writing docs for things like CLIs and packages for Node.js, and it renders nicely in a variety of tools.
But markdown can fall a little short when documenting front-end UI components.

MDX was built with some of this in mind.

While there are several great libraries and frameworks out there for creating high-quality documentation sites, such as Next.js, Gatsy, Docusaurus, and Docz, many of these tools require some setup and configuration and can be a distraction if you're trying to quickly create documentation for something new.
There are also tools out there for quickly developing components in isolation,
but they use proprietary APIs and don't scale well, still requiring separate documentation as a project grows.

## Introducing mdx-go

A tool for progressive documentation

- Zero setup
- Focus on writing docs
- Portability of MDX
- Upgrade to a fully-featured solution when needed
  - mdx-docs
- Continue using mdx-go as a dev tool
  - Prototyping
  - Sandbox
  - Drafts for official docs site

Also great for

- Component demos
- Simple static sites
